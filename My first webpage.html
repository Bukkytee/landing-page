		<h2>History 1</h2>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> is a markup language used primarily to create hypertext Web pages, which are published on the Web and displayed in any Web browser. A markup language is a set of notationsthat specifies how the content should look in the browser. HTML is derived from <b>Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</b>, which is the mother language of HTML. SGML is a markup language that defines the structure of other markup languages.</p>

		<h2>History 2</h2>
		<p>HTML has evolved over the years with the introduction of improved set of standards and specifications. HTML 1.0 was the first version of HTML introduced in <u>1993</u>. At that time, there were very less people involved in designing websites. HTML 2.0 was introduced in 1995 and included the complete HTML 1.0 specifications with additional features. The other versions are as follows:</p>

		</div>
		<div class="third">
		<ul>
			<li><b>HTML 3.0</b><br/><br/>HTML 3.0 specifications included new features for the Netscape Navigator browser as it became very popular. The new improvements did not work on any other browsers such as Internet Explorer. Therefore, this specification was abandoned.</li><br/>
			<li><b>HTML 3.2</b><br/><br/>Additional browser specific features revolutionized the need for standardization of HTML. Therefore, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) organisation was formed to specify and maintain the HTML standards. HTML 3.2 was the first specification introduced by W3C in January 1997 and was fully supported by all the web browsers.</li><br/>
			<li><b>HTML 4.0</b><br/><br/>W3C introduced HTML 4.0 in December 1997 with the motive for facilitating support for CSS, DHTML and JavaScript. However, HTML 4.0 prevailed for a short period and was revised, which led to HTML 4.01 specification in 1999.</li><br/>
			<li><b>HTML 5</b><br/><br/>HTML 5 is a cooperative project between the W3C and the Web HyperText Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</li><br/>
