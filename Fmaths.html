			<p>The <b><i>New Further Mathematics 5th Revised Edition Books 1, 2 and 3</i></b> are completely revised, based on the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) Revised Syllabus. In addition, the syllabuses of the various examination bodies- the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), Nigerian Examinations Council (NECO) and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (for UTME) as well as some other professional examination bodies- are carefully blended into the NERDC Revised Syllabus, as in the earlier editions.</p><br/>
		<p><b>The NERDC, in the revised syllabus states (quote):</b></p>
			In this revision, Coordinate Geometry and Operations Research (OR) are added for enrichment of the curriculum in line with current trends and for added value orientation with capital market and real life applications in mind.<br/><br/>
			As in the original curriculum, this revision focuses on the following objectives:
			<ol>
				<li>It helps the students to develop conceptual and manipulative skills in mathematics so as to prepare them for further studies in mathematics and its application.</li><br/>
				<li>It reflects continuity with those used in Universities, Polytechnics, Federal Colleges of Education and Colleges of Science and Technology, so that graduates of the curriculum have nothing to unlearn on entering any of the above mentioned institutions.</li><br/>
				<li>It is meant for potential Mathematicians, Engineers and Scientists.</li><br/>
			</ol>
		<p>This revised curriculum is recommended for students with high ability in general mathematics who will need to acquire a good foundation for future studies in mathematics or mathematics related courses (unquote).</p><br/>
		<p><b>Highlights of the texts of the three books include:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clearly stated objectives at the beginning of each chapter</li><br/>
				<li>Numerous, relevant illustrations</li><br/>
